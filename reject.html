                So... Yeah this was abit silly. i thought tho after we talked about it, that it'd be kinda cute and funny if i made this website. I did work hard on it, but im glad because it helped me refine my skills and it was worth a shot. Thanks for being the best person i've met in 2025, truly a one of a kind person. </br> </br> (ts so awkward.. my first time doing anything on Valentines day)
